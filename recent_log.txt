[2023-06-25 20:53:09] <cantelope> There are few life events with the emotional force to shift or cancel ALL existing priorities
[2023-06-25 20:54:50] <cantelope> Among these events is a legitimate sudden heartbreak, whereby goals and whole continents of values, plans, and feelings are violently disconnected forever
[2023-06-25 20:56:08] <efex> ok
[2023-06-25 20:56:30] <cantelope> Sometimes leaving the one with a broken heart adrift and mechanically grasping at the void where once half of their being existed
[2023-06-25 20:58:21] <cantelope> People offer money, sympathy and furrowed brows, failing to recognize the uselessness of these things, in the vacuum left behind

[2023-06-25 21:28:09] <efex> fools :-(
[2023-06-25 21:34:42] <cantelope> There are 2 kinda of people, the 96% majority who hesitate, make only safe bets, lead boring lives, die old and are forgotten instantly. And there are the rare ones who compulsively hold nothing back, err on the side of bravery almost to a fault, especially in matters of romance because they understand that without risk, an investment has no possible return
[2023-06-25 21:36:16] <efex> that’s too binary for me.
[2023-06-25 21:36:27] <cantelope> When one of these rare people is assaulted by someone who concentrates and deliberately betrays, aims to destroy, and finally disappears, the effects of heartbreak are amplified to an inhumane, paralyzing extent 
[2023-06-25 21:36:53] <efex> did these things happen to you?
[2023-06-25 21:37:46] <cantelope> Loss can be on a level that shifts or cancels all existing priorities
[2023-06-25 22:00:24] <cantelope> In the movie "princess and the warrier" the male part of a young couple who scheme to rob a grocery store, is shown in exquisite cinematic style to experience such a sudden cancellation of all his priorities when his beloved companion is shot dead during the heist
[2023-06-25 22:01:48] <cantelope> In slow motion, his weapon falls from his hand and police are seen taking position in the background, which to him occurs in another universe, this one fully occupied by his dying love
[2023-06-25 22:02:00] <cantelope> As she lay on the asphalt
[2023-06-25 22:02:30] <cantelope> The Princess and the Warrior*
[2023-06-25 22:06:54] <cantelope> This all has no bearing on my life at present, but is a thing I've been searching for words to describe for a while
[2023-06-25 22:07:52] <cantelope> A real, catastrophic column collapse within a person on an Amy winehouse level

[2023-06-26 04:36:13] <Timur> cantelope: wb. I am sorry for whatever event that was which so affected you
[2023-06-26 04:47:44] <cantelope> Well, not one adult is without the experience to some degree. But like I said, this is neither a fresh event in my life nor about me per se. I have been passively thinking about the idea of total priority annihilation resulting from sudden loss, for a while. I feel my description yesterday was apt
[2023-06-26 04:48:29] <Timur> I didn't see it, but I'm sure you're right.. traumatic events can be / often are life-changing.
[2023-06-26 04:49:22] <cantelope> So many people (e.g. Amy winehouse) withdraw into substance abuse and pariahship, never comprehending the psychology of it
[2023-06-26 04:49:56] <Timur> sure
[2023-06-26 04:50:11] <cantelope> You saw it
[2023-06-26 04:50:28] <cantelope> The text you're responding to was my description
[2023-06-26 04:50:48] <Timur> I did not; I'm extrapolating based upon your current description
[2023-06-26 04:51:33] <cantelope> You saw something or you wouldn't have opened a dialog just now
[2023-06-26 04:52:40] <Timur> I saw your description of the movie and how you related to it
